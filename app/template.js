About IC      Cultural Awareness/Mindfulness      Cross-Cultural Efficacy      Intersectionality          Unconscious Bias

Intersectionality- The theory that the overlap of various social identities, as race,gender, sexuality, and class, contributes to the specific type of systemic oppression, privilege and discrimination experienced by an individual (Crenshaw, 1989)

Cultural Awareness/Mindfulness
To culturally be mindful and aware. Mindfulness meaning.. . Mindfulness is a state of conscious awareness in which the individual is implicitly aware of the context and content of information. It is a state of openness to novelty in which the individual actively constructs categories and distinctions. In contrast, mindlessness is a state of mind characterized by an overreliance on categories and distinctions drawn in the past and in which the individual is context-dependent and, as such, is oblivious to novel (or simply alternative) aspects of the situation. Langer, 1992: 289


Unconscious Bias
Unconscious bias refers to a bias that we are
unaware of, and which happens outside of our
control. It is a bias that happens automatically
and is triggered by our brain making quick
judgments and assessments of people and
situations, influenced by our background,
cultural environment and personal experiences

(ECU: 2013 Unconscious bias in higher education)

Cross-Cultural/Intersectional Efficacy
    
Nunez (2000) prefers and describes cross-cultural efficacy as a term that implies
that the caregiver or service provider such as a teacher is effective in interactions that involve individuals of different cultures through the neutral view of neither the
caregiver’s nor the patient’s culture is the preferred or more accurate view. This term is adaptable to the academic sector by applying it to the learning environment to the dynamic of the teacher and student. It is also applicable to the business sector with management and team members.

Additionally, Cross-Cultural/Intersectional Efficacy involves diverse cultures and the intersections of social identities such as race, sex, gender and sexual identity (Barber & Overton, 2017).
 The logo would go with this one I will send it separately. But you will have to extract it. Thanks . Let me know if you have questions. These are just definitions to start the sections.
